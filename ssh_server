ssh server:
 secure shell - gives the remote access of the server , telnet's successor : ssh - linux , telnet - windows
 
 even after we remove the ssh lib , while using ssh server , it won't terminate the session
 config file: /etc/ssh/ssh_config
 
 installation:
>  yum install openssh-server
> restart the service: systemctl restart sshd.service = or won't be able to connect
 the port is allowed default by firewall
 change the port:
 go to config file and change the port via "Port" option in the file , ListenAddress is the address to listen to which ip address: {attack vector down} , can give multiple IP address
 
 
 the -p switch helps the port to specify : ssh -p
  ps: allow the port from firewall
  
  > only allow specific users or don't allow root: Permitrootlogin change it to NO and uncomment it
  
  > login via public and private key: 
  change the publickeyauthentication - yes and uncomment it
  and change the passwordauthentication to NO
  go to config file : there you'll see the Authorizedkeyfiles <file location> default is .ssh/authorized_keys
  
  ssh-keygen --help = for help
  we'll use rsa
  > ssh-keygen -t rsa
  this will create 2 files: .pub and pvt files for pub and pvt key
  the public key will be named to authorized_keys and transfer the other one to those of your local pc, also the pvt key file must have the permission - 600
  
  so to login with the key:
  ssh -p <port> -i <key location> <usr>@<ip>

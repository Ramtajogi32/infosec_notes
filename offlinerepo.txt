we first instert the iso file of the centos and mount it from /dev/sr0 to /mnt/ then we go to the centos folder ni mnt and see the packages in the iso file,
then we cpy them in other location in /centos  , then we unmount it via umount /mnt/

also if you have the iso downloaded ,just mount it via this command:
mount -t iso 9660 <loaction where it is> <location to mount>

now we need to get this package ,it's there in centos-everything but if not please install as we'll be making a DB with all the packages we have + the dependencies they require , we'll create a repo and for that we need this package:
                        createrepo-0.9.9-28.el7.noarch.rpm

this create repo hasi itself 2 dependencies: delta-rpm and python-deltarpm

now we give the command: createrepo -v --database <location of packages in centos> what it does is it reads all packages and creates the database
since we never defined the location to where to put the DB , it makes it in the same location : named repodata -> a sql database
we can create it anywhere via -o



now we havw the DB but we need it to link with yum go to /etc/yum.repos.d then yum repolist all , gives list of all repo
clean everything via yum clean all , it cleans all the cache of repos, to make it again yum repoall
the repos we see are all online but we want everything offline so clean first
then move everthing of this yu.repos.d to anywhere, or disable it  we need the offline repos here
create a file <name>.repo we'll put some info in it

[centos7]   # this should be unique , no special chars
name=Centos 7 Everything
baseurl=file:///home/acharya/centos/Packages/ # server location or local location
gpgcheck=0 #



if this doesn't work move centos7 to root

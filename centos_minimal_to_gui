give ip address via ip ad
ip up <wifi name via infconfig>

give static ip via: 
ssh into the server
yum repolist all , now we need to instal EPEL , yum install epel-release.noarch

yum repolist all
then install all the repos in screenshot
yum -ivh <screenshot>

we need bash-completion.noarch = this auto completes the commands, also do yum install bash*
 
 there are also groups of packages that we can install for certain tasks
 
 yum groupslist
 the choose the grp u want to install , like we want development and creative workstation
 
 if want info then do: yum groups info "<name>"
 also can check summary via groups summary "<name>"
 
 then to install  : yum groups install "<name>"
 if wanna remove: yum groups remove "name" -y
 it caches the package tho ... so that it can reinstall faster : /var/cache/yum/x86_64/7/base/packages
 
 for gui use mate or gnome desktop or kde
 yum group install mate/kde/gnome
 
 then install server with GUI group
 use systemctl set-default graphical.target
 then systemctl isolate graphical.target

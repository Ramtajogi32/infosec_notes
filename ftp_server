ftp runs on port 21
first do
 rpm -qa | grep ftp 
 if you have 2 packages saying ftp , vsftpd , well and good if not do this: yum install vsftpd ftp
    vsftpd is the server and ftp is the client

    do rpm -qc vsftpd-3.0.2-29.el7_9.x86_64  or your package for vsftpd via rpm -qa | grep ftp

    the main file is the /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
    we'll open it in vim , see there's a variable called anonymous_enable=YES , this allows the users to login anonymously, without correct password
    we'll have to add some anonymous lines to allow the prt ranges and all so that we could access the server:

    pasv_min_port=55000
    pasv_max_port=55999
    pasv_enable=YES

    give any range you want 
    systemctl restart vsftpd 
    systemctl enable vsftpd - if you want to enable it after pc starts
    if you have iptables enabled , allow the port :
        -A input -p tcp --dport 21 -j ACCEPT
        -A input -p tcp --dport 55000:55999 -j ACCEPT

        we can access the only files through ftp which is in the dir called: /var/ftp, give those files 777 permissions for ftp server to access them

        then if you use the creds : ftp:<any passwd> , you can login to ftp server
        you can type help for variious commands that you can execute , also you can also get files via get <filename> or multiple files via mget <file1> <file2>
        to get the  server location : use pwd
        to get the local location of machine: lcd
        here ls command doesn't work , instead there's a combination:
        lcd + tabkey

        there are various moeds that are enabled to transfer certain files:
        default mode is ascii and for binary files it's binary mode
        we can switch modes just by typing their names

        now we use FILEZILLA to use ftp service in GUI based OS , so to use filezilla first we need to do some things in server:
            go to vsftpd.confwe can also use file browser of windows - ftp://<ip>


            FILEZILLA:  
                give the ip in the ip box and no username and passwd , if the anon login is snabled , if not use the creds, it's simple to use , double click on the file
                to download or right click and choose download , also we can drag and drop if the permission is there for the user

        NOW go to conf file again and change the anonymous_enable=NO
        line no. 101 : chroot_local_user=YES, uncomment it , also add this allow_writeable_chroot=YES at last befor the pam_service

        now ftp user won't be able to login
        but we can use local users to login anywhere , ps: you can't lgin via root now , why read ahead
        
        go to conf file again: chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd/chroot_list uncomment it , if this file is not there , make it
        add at last: 
        userlist_enable=YES
        userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd/allow_users
        userlist_deny=NO
        
        this will be our allow list , make it via vim , if you give the manes in the file , they will only be able to login
        
        we want only selected users to not to login: go to /etc/vsftpd/user_list - add name so that they won't be able to login ,see this file , root is included , just make it
        a comment , root is a powerful user , ftp land in root's dir, it can be dangerous

        please comment out the users from the ftpuser and user_list , before adding to the allow_user list or they won't be able to login



        what if we want to change location of access of ftp users:
            go to conf file and add this line
            local_root=/<directoryname>

            then the directory will appear everytime a user logs into ftp

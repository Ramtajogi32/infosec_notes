LAN- 
switch is used in this type of network , earlier hubs were used
2m - 100m {2pc - 1000pc}

CAN - campus area ntwrk
l3 switch is used -2m -1km  {2-1000 pc}

MAN - metropolitan area ntwrk
2m - much further , router is used
we use domestic routers, but the routers used in man is different they are much powerful and expensive

WAN - btw to cities
leasiline connection = when isp is used to connect two points in wan , it provides us the router and  cables


wireless connection:
PAN - personal area network
WLAN - wireless lan {mini router} 20m - 50m
WCAN - wifi AP {access point} 


OSI MODEL:
pc goes to data link layer if pvt. or when in public goes to networking layer
in DL layer mac add devices are there: switch and bridges , in the LAN DL layer is used for comm. 
when the data goes from pc to outer wrld , it gets to media layer , the use of this layer is just to transmit the data in media layer , mac address works not ip

switchea create a CAM table that contain the info of all devices connected

CAM:
port No.(the ports of switches not the tcp ports) - Mac address
for mac address to braodcast , the 	mac address is FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF


ICMP = PROTOCOL we send the packet we get the response , if 4 req , 4 response network management protocol

IGMP : internet group management protocol : manages the network checks if gateway available or not


TRansport layer protocol;
TCP:
transmission control protocols: and internet protocol:
	uses port on each sides
	3 way handshake
			syn  
			ack  syn
			ack
	after the connection is established then the application layer protocols come in picture
	
	no 3 way handshake in udp 
	NFS is used in linux  NETWORK FILE SHARING PROTOCOL

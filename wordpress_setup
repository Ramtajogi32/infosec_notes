download phpmyadmin first , download the current latest version at my time it was : 5.2.0 , download the all_languages.zip file for ease 
uni\zip it via : unzip phpmyadmin..... {cammand}
now take that  newly unzipped folder to the  /var/www/html or the specific directory you wanna create the admin panel for your website , if you use different location , 
please remember to include that in your httpd.conf file , and change its name to phpmyadmin for ease of access
now we need to change the owner of this file from root to apache : chown -vR apache:apache <folder>

now check your localhost/phpmyadmin website or any other domain you used , you will see a login page , use the creds:  username:root
                                                                                                                       password: <the one you gave for mysql>

you might be getting an error above the taskbar panel of the desktop saying: needs a secret passphrase {blowfish_secret} : that's due to the passphrase we need to provide it in the config file : config.sample.inc.php
it needs a passphrase for maintaining a config file , so we're gonna give it to him
change it's name:
cp config.sample.inc.php config.inc.php

the file needs 32 bit complex passphrase so we generate it via openssl's random method:  openssl rand -base64 22 , it's 22 not 32 , it's not a typo!!!!!!

now download wordpress from wordpress.org , download latest , at my time it was 6.0.1   , unzip it , move that folder  to /var/www/html ,change the ownership to apache
chown -vR apache:apache <folder> 
now we need to give some executable and wr permissions:
chmod -Rv 0755 wp-includes/ wp-admin/js/ wp-content/themes/ wp-content/plugins/

also we need to change it's config file: vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

add this: also if you have certs and all and different ip , use creds as per wish

Listen 8080
<Virtualhost 192.168.29.248:8080>
#        SSLEngine on

        ServerName drona.acharya.local
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/wordpress
        DirectoryIndex index.php


</Virtualhost>



after we configured wp , we need to create a database , now phpmyadmin comes in picture ,we create a db from here:
go to database menu and just give a name for now and press create "worpress_dabatase"


go to wordpress site choose english , let's go, and put the db name , username , password as per phpmyadmin page and host is localhost and then login

give site title .....and all 
done!

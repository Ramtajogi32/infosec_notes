types of partition:
> primary
>  extended
	> logical

> blkid = gives the uuid of the disks in use [universal unique id]

lsblk = details of all the partitions of the harddisk  in a tree format

fdisk -l  = same info points with much more info to give

fdisk -l <particular disk>

to create the partitions for the disk: fdisk
fdisk <disk>
for help: m , from that see that to make new partition: n , then p for primary

+10G for 10 gb or can give mb kb and gb

to delete : d
by default it deletes last but we cqn give number for specific part

we can make only one extended , logical uses extended's space but primary goes for unused

when we type w , it implements all the changes and to revert the changes just type q

to change the id; l ,Id determines the type and  to change the type of filesystem like NTFS and all change the id



NOW WE CREATED THE PARTITIONS , NOW WE NEED TO FORMAT IT:
make filesystem:   mkfs.<filesystem>
if there is no ntfs : yum install ntfs*


so: mkfs.ext4 /dev/sd<whatever is the no. of ext4>

like this :
mkfs.xfs , mkfs.ntfs

NOW WE NEED TO MOUNT:
what is the default mountings: df -h
we need to make folders foroue partitons ...like mkdir d1 d2 d3 d4..

then - mount <what to mount like /dev/sd...> <where to mount where the dirs are made>

mount -t <name> <what to mount> <where to  mount>
like: mount -t ntfs /dev/sdd2 /ntfs_filesystem

TO UNMOUNT:
umount </dev/sd...>

they will be unmounted by default after a restart

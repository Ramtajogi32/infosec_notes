used in developer env , this tool is for file handling via browser

you must first have the dav_fs_module in the server if not use: yum install httpd*
how to check: httpd -M | grep fs

make the directory /var/www/html/webdav - make the owner and grp apache via chown apache:apache /var/www/html/webdav and change its permissions to 777 via /var/www.....
go to httpd.conf file in etc/httpd/conf/ and like this: place the content:
<virtualhost 192.168.29.248:80>
        ServerName drona.acharya.local
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/
        DirectoryIndex index.html
        <Directory /var/www/html/webdav>
                DAV on
        </Directory>
</virtualhost>

save and exit, restart service

do curl -v -X OPTIONS http://192.168.29.248/webdav/       {give your own ip and port}
 check which methods it support
or if you use https ssl:
 curl -i -k -X OPTIONS https://192.168.29.248/webdav/


 now we put some file into this dir:  
 curl -X PUT -d "hello from curl" http://192.168.29.248/webdav/hellocurl.txt

 or use cadaver:
 in kali it's there: cadaver http://192.168.29.248/webdav/
 be sure to give exact file location in cadaver or else it shows request refused or closed

 use htpasswd for access auth via: htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/htpasswd <username> and paste these lines onto the virtualhost directory tag after dav on line:
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "dav"
    AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/htpasswd
    Require valid-user
restart the service

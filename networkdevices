NIC: card :
1. pci lan card

mac address:
	physical adderss , of 12 digit hexadecimal number , 48 bits in lingth
	xx:yy:zz:aa:bb:cc
	starting 6 -manufacturer is represnented last 6 is represented for devices
	whichever company assigns the mac addess , the starting bit is same eg:
	00a0c90000000 TO 00a0c9ffffff
	
	
	just like the phones , there's IMEI number , the unique identity , the sim slot ,it can't be changed , to do it reprogram it but MAC addresses can't be reprogrammed , MAC addresses can be spoofed though
	
	91crpc = find the imei number , which sim is being used by this phone ,
	the ISPs have the data for that which sim is being used by this number same goes with sim , which sim has been switch to which IMEIs
	
	software vendors also have that imei
	
	> repeater = regenerates the data before sending and sends further (single port)
works on physical layer

> hub=  gives signal to all in devices

> bridge: reduces the traffic by table addresssing , like table A contains mac address of 1 group and B gives of other group
layer 2 working (datakink)

> switch works on layer 2-3
2 versions of switch

> router when connecting the 2 networks layer 3 working

> firewall:  IDS and IPS :
placed on the networks , intrusion detection system = it alerts the system admin but doesn't do something about it
intrusion  prevention system = it detects and prevents it

> modem : modulation and demod

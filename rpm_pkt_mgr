packet managers:
for finding the rpms = rpmfind.net	

rpm - red hat package manager
package  = collection of files
"pkgnme-version-release-architecture-extension"
rpm contains the binaries, while srpm contains the source code  of the binary , we have to compile it before executing
i386 = 32 bit, x86 = 64 bit, noarch = platform independent

/etc/os-release: gives the details of the os

rpm -q <app/package> = gives if installed or not

if we don't know the package name = rpm -qa -> gives the name of all packages
then we can grep it

for latest installation: rpm -qa --last
-qi = gives the info of a particular pkg
-ql = gives the list of all the files + location of that pkg  
they come with -q<commands>:
c = config files , d= doc files , r = dependencies of the packages, L = lists the pkgs liscences
-q --provides -> who's providing the pkg 
s = 

when you wanna be sure what that pkg u downloaded does before downloading is just give this command:
or not even downloading just give the command with the link to download it
rpm -qpi <pkg location>/<link>

-Vv = verifies instead of -q


installations:
rpm -Vv <pkgname> => gives that if some dependencies are missing or all are available

pacakeg selection:
to get which package is the part of which one -> rm -qf <package>

for installation of pkg:
rpm -ivh i for installl v for verbose h for human readable
to check if installed or not -> rpm -qai | grep <pkg> here i means info

rpm --nodeps -ivh <pkg> -> pkg dependent available in system or not , just install it


to remove:
rpm -evh <pkg>
rpm -Uvh  <pkg>   U for upgrade

to install all the packages that are with extension rpm or any other:
rpm -ivh "*.rpm"


rpm packages = elrepo , 
yum check-updates
yum udate info
yum update
yum search <pkt>
yum install bash*
yum remove <pkt>
mostly, never remove dependencies

yum provides <application> = where to get repo

yum downgrade <pkg> = just to downgrade
yum deplist <pkg>= dependencies list

yum reinstall <pkg>
yum downgrade <pkg> --skip-broken
yum makecache
yum history
yum languageavaible
yum distro-sync = syncs distro , says to update if nnew version comes

email tracking:
	there are various agents: 
		1. MUA: mail user agent: they are the application or the webservices that manage the mails and let us do too
		eg: mozzila thunderbird , microsoft outlook
		
		
		2. mail transfer agents: when we mail the recipient the mail is forwarded to our service provider's mail  it's done by mail transfer agent's to transfer it to server. eg: SMTP
			port: 25 and ssl:
		
		3.Mail delivery agent:
			this agent is for delivering the mail from the server to us
			they are of two types: IMAP and POP	
			
how to setup:
	download the user-agent in your system . I'd prefer thunderbird since it's easy to setup
	
	CHOOSE FROM IMAP OR POP , imap has local copy in pc and one in mail but pop has local copy only nothing in server
	if you don't want it'll go default
	send a mail to yourself and then check from the webmail client like gmail and right click on the gmail and choose option "show original" and read the details
	
	
	read from bottom: 
	<content>
	<from> {not to trust this}
	<to> 
	<message id> { this is the accurate mark that where the real mail is , like where it is from }
	
	<received> {this gives the private and public ip}
	<return path> {also good for further knowledge}
	
	
MOZZILA:
	<body in form of html>
	<from>
	<to>
	<received> <actual public ipv6> <ip mozzila used to route>
	


OUTLOOK:
	<content>
	<from>
	<to>
	<message id> {shows that the outlook.com or the application is used to send the mail or any other client}
	
	ps: if the mail is not sent from application you won't see the sender's public ip
	
if teh received says unknown or localhost , it's either proxy or other blocking 
	

TOOLS:
	[ip2location] - gives the path of the mail - where , where it went , just place the email headers we got from above clients , paste eveything if you don't know what to send

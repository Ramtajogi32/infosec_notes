dir listing: the browser has a bad habit of listing out all the files of directory irrespective of the owner or group , but only in the absence of the index file , when the index file is present , it default loads the 
file itself , but when it's not present , it loads everything: "sanjivni nai mili to pahad utha laaya" kinda thing

there are various ways to stop this:
way 1:
 make the indexed file or any other one you specified to open in httpd.conf file

way 2: through server end:
 paste these lines in the httpd.conf file:
 inside the virtual host that hosts your wensite
    <Directory /var/www/html/wordpress>
        Options -Indexes
    </Directory>
but still if you need to read any file , and know the name , you can read it still

also if you want to enable listing in some cases: 

<Directory /var/www/html/site1>

        Options Indexes
        Order allow,deny # order to read the code
        Allow from <ip1> <ip2> .. # add only if you want specific ips to access this you can also give all as an option
        Deny from <ip>...# to deny some ip
</Directory>

<Directory /var/www/html/wordpress>
        Options -Indexes
</Directory>

way 3:
 
 authenticate via id , password: 
    <Directory /var/www/html/wordpress>
        Options -Indexes
        AllowOverride Authconfig
    </Directory>

and make an .htaccess file in the dir you want to authorize: eg: 
AuthName "<username>"
AuthType basic
AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/htpasswd
Require valid-user


also make the auth file that we stated in the text: 
command: htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/htpasswd <username>
give the password and all


HOME DIRECTORY LISTING:
vim /etc/httpd/conf.d/userdir.conf

first enable the UserDir: UserDir enabled
then uncomment the last line public_html one , save and exit
create user: useradd <name> ,give passwd etc...
then create the dir public_html : mkdir /home/<user>/public_html , give owneership to user
give executing permission to user dir: chmod 711 /home/<user>

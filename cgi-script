yum install perl perl-CGI

install them , you need to have cgi_module , check via: httpd -M | grep -i cgi , make sure selinux is disabled , to check : sestatus , to disable: vim /etc/systemctl/selinux and make it "disabled"


open the httpd.conf file , if you on vim : give the command: ":set number" and see the line number 247 , it says "ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/var/www/cgi-bin/" this is an alias , we can call it directly via: cgi-bin

few lines under it there will be a directory tag with some values , modify them with this:
AllowOverride None
     Options +ExecCGI
     AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl .py .sh
     Require all granted

restart service 
to check we make a file in the location in the: /var/www/cgi-bin/test.cgi and paste this:
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "<h1> server memory usage: </h1>";
print "<pre>";
exec("free -h");
print("</pre>");

we can apply password to this file too , use <dirctory> tag.....

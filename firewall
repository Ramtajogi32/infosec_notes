iptables:
install the supporting packages for iptables also:

systemctl status iptables.service
systemctl status firewalld.service
systemctl mask firewalld.service , if we leave it marked , its good no need to uninstall

systemctl start iptables.service
systemctl start ip6tables.service

systemctl enable iptables.service
systemctl enable ip6tables.service {to start at startups}

iptables -L = rules
iptables -L -n  = rules in numeric form

iptables -n -L <particular chain name>
iptables -n -L --line-numbers

same rules goes to ip6tables


rule 1 says accept all protocol(target) from whichever source to which ever dest ip of server


now rule 2 says : which pkt want to pass icmp 
then rule 3 says transport layer all pkts whether tcp or udp protocol
nc -nlvp <port>
to check it runs = netstat -nltup 

can't connect now due to fw , so we allow it 	
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A <service> -p <which network protocol> --dport <port> -j <action>

iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 21 -j DROP

if wireshark says RST ,ACK in reply to our SYN - either its down {service} or pct rejected	


to delete rule:
iptables -D INPUT <line no.>

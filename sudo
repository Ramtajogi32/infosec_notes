sudo :
super user do
root        ALL=(ALL) ALL
               HOSTS   ANY USER  OTHERS(3RD PRTY)
               1ST ALL says rule applies to all hosts
               2nd = user in the 1st column can run it with privelages
               3rd says any command can be run
               
   when I say:
  root 		u1,u2=(ALL) ALL  u1 and u2 can access root
  
  ALL=(armour:armour)  ALL this means root can use the pwr of armour user and grp from any pc 
  
  sudo -l displays the powers
  
  
  sudo -u <usr> command
  there's  a group called wheel that gives the same power as root
  groups <usr> - displsys grps
  
  visudo checks before saving the /etc/sudoers file , best option
  
  
  when : armour localhost=(ALL) ALL
  whenever host is localhost, armour can run any cmmnd 
  
  when armour=(r1) ALL
  
  we learnt the user alias and the command alias
  
  now comes the 3rd ALL:
  the command alias
  # we have to define the aliases then we can give the command like this:
  Cmnd_Alias ARMOUR_CMD = usr/bin/id,usr/bin/mkdir,usr/bin/ls
  
  then we give the:
  USER1     ALL=(ALL)   ARMOUR_CMD
  
  
  NO PASSWORD:  usr doesn't need any kind of password to run these commands and PASSWD:  needs passwords for this
  USER1     ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD:  ARMOUR_CMD, PASSWD: /usr/bin/sudo
  
  
  how to reset root password?:
 halt the boot loader in the options mode
 press e for rescue mode
 turn "ro" to:
 rw init=/sysroot/sbin/sh go to rw mode and start hotw hi i need this command
 
 
 to set passwd on grub: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTubAMSjqlA
 SElinux is disabled , means changes can't be saved , now give certain commands 
 to prevent this , implement password in grub go to /etc/grub.d/10_linux
 
then: grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2, copy the hash given, 
vim /etc/grub.d/10_linux -> go to end of file and then edit as this :

set superusers="Siddh"
password_pbkdf2 Siddh  
then  grub2-mkcinfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

OR
/boot/grub2/grub.cfg
give command:
grub2-setpassword
set it and cat the new file that nis made in the above folder: user.cfg
then we'll get the password 


what if we forget this password too?

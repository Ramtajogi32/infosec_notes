so when we install the service called httpd we get to know that the main file is httpd/conf/httpd.conf which can be seen in a particular location by 
rpm -qc httpd-2.4.6-95.el7.centos.x86_64 , or your pkg name , check via:
rpm -qa | grep httpd

allow the firewall to run server on port 80
fot iptables:
-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT 

keep your html , php files in the /var/www/html , change the user to apache via chown apache <file> ,uske bina bhi kaam ho jayega but still
remember to disable the sestatus  ,it messes up the config
type: sestatus
go to /etc/sysconfig/selinux - disable it

now we come to the part where we change the content of the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file

there are 4 types of configs: 1. via port 2. via ip 3. via name 4. via type 

if you want to change location of the website docs to be browsed : 
change the DocumentRoot variable in the file, if you want to change the name of the file it calls from index to any other: change the IfModule tag

2. VIA IP:

place this at the last of the file:
<VirtualHost 192.168.29.248:80>
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site1
        DirectoryIndex index.html
</VirtualHost>

for eerror check use: httpd -t	
for different ips do the same virtual host text, place it in same manner in the httpd file

3. via name
<VirtualHost 192.168.29.248:80>
	ServerName drona.acharya.local
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site1
        DirectoryIndex index.html
	ServerAlias www.drona.acharya.local
</VirtualHost>

sequence matters ,also check the dns forward zone file and edit if required , or to point different ip if needed



INSTALL HTTPS AND SSL CERT IN OUR SITE:
yum install mod_ssl
it installes the file somewhat like this: mod_ssl-2.4.6-95.el7.centos.x86_64
do rpm -ql mod_ssl-2.4.6-95.el7.centos.x86_64 
we get to see the Httpd/ssl.conf file , this is the main file that we'll use to configure ssl

restart the service , alllow the port for the firewall , 443 port , 
from the /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl,conf grep these two lines : 
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key

we'll paste them in our file httpd.conf file

it should look like this: 
<Virtualhost 192.168.29.248:80>
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
	ServerName drona.acharya.local
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/site1
	DirectoryIndex index.html
    

</Virtualhost>


now we'll generate our own public and pvt key ,

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 

now paste cert.pem in the file folder: /etc/pki/tls/certs/cert.pem
and key in /etc/pki/tls/private/key.pem
change the file location of the SSLCertificate in the .conf file in httpd

when we restart the service we get this prompt that the password that we provided during the key generation , we nee dt type that every time so to skip this step here's the procedure:
openssl genrsa -out ca.key

then we convert it to another  file: openssl req -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr , we'll generate pvt keyusing this:
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt
place the files in certs and private - crt and key respectively

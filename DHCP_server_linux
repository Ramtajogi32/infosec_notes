DHCP SERVER IN LINUX :
step 1- install pkg
step 2 - configure the file 
step 3- restart service
step 4- allow the service to run for firewall


-> yum repolist all
install dhcp 
then there's a file called dhcpd.conf.example  = that gives the example and instructions to see 
 
change this file : /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

this is the format
authoritative; 
# we use authoritative when we use ADDS so that it gets authority to give IPs
       #specify network address and subnet mask
        subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0{
       }
                #specify the range of lease IP address
                range 192.168.1.50 192.168.1.250;
                #specify default gateway
                option routers 192.168.1.1;
                #DNS servers for name resolution
                option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4;
                #specify broadcast address
                option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;
                #default lease time
                default-lease-time 600;
                #max lease time
                max-lease-time 7200;


then : netstat -nltup 
	dhcp runs on udp 67 for server aand 68 for client
	systemctl start dhcpd.service
	note: service won't start if there's a config mistake
	
vim /etc/sysconfig/iptables
	allow port 67 
	
to give single ip: just give the single ip as range stating and ending both : 192.168.1.22 192.168.1.22

to give a particular ip to a particular client:

host <hostname>{
                #MAC address of client for fix ip
                hardware ethernet 08:00:27:5d:b8:bc;
                #IP address for client
                fixed-address 192.168.1.201;
               }
               
               
allow list : give the line at last of the msg from line 15 in text : deny unknown-clients


or do this: host <hostname> {hardware ethernet <mac add> ;deny booting } and remove the line deny unknown-clients

to allow and deny acc to condition: 	
	make a pool , like this:
		pool{
				range < start ip> <end ip>
			}
then provide bthis:
host <hostname> {hardware ethernet <mac add>}

creating multiple pools will apply as respectively to the host as in number
